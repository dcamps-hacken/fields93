# I'm David, a Solidity Smart Contract Developer üëã


üêæ I am a young developer from Barcelona, Spain (CET). 

üíª After some years working as an R&D engineer at Hewlett-Packard, I took a break and spend some time abroad. Once back, I decided to transition towards Web3 as a Solidity Smart Contract Developer. 

üå± Since early 2021, I've been diving into the crypto space, playing around with many dApps and communities. 


## Web3 Experience
I have a wide user experience with many Web3 spaces - specially DeFi and NFTs -, as well as different EVM blockchains such as Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Fantom, Avalanche, ZkSync or Arbitrum. 

On those different chains I gathered knowledge about NFTs, CEXs, DEXs, AMMs, Staking, LP, Flash Loans, Arbitraging, Launchpads and Analytics.

## Technical Skills
As a developer I focus on building Smart Contracts in Solidity, either in simple Remix projects or complex tested ones in Hardhat. Some other tools I use are: 

‚ö°Metamask -- As a wallet to deploy on testnets or mainnets.

‚ö°Alchemy and Infura -- Nodes to connect to blockchains.

‚ö°Etherscan -- And other blockchain explorers to verify contracts, interact with them and get additional info.

‚ö°VSCode and Git -- To develop and organize code, to be later updated on Github.

‚ö°OpenZeppelin -- Libraries, specially ERC20 and ERC721.

‚ö°Chainlink -- Tools to develop hybrid smart contracts, both Data Feeds and VRF. Soon working with Keepers.

‚ö°Slither and Manticore -- From Trail of Bits to filter out smart contract vulnerabilities.

‚ö°IPFS and Filecoin -- To store NFTs.

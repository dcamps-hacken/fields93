# Hey there, I'm David üëã 

A former Hewlett-Packard R&D Engineer from Barcelona (CET). I entered the crypto space in early 2021 and decided to play an active role as a <b>Solidity Smart Contract Developer</b>.

> I have user experience with many Web3 spaces - specially DeFi and NFTs -, as well as different EVM blockchains such as Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Fantom, Avalanche, ZkSync or Arbitrum. On those different chains I gathered knowledge about NFTs, CEXs, DEXs, AMMs, Staking, LP, Flash Loans, Arbitraging, Launchpads and Analytics.


### Technical Skills
As a developer I focus on building Smart Contracts in Solidity, either in simple Remix projects or complex tested ones in Hardhat. Some other tools I use are:

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/tools-Infura&Alchemy-informational?style=flat&logo=<LOGO_NAME>&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a)

>‚ö°Metamask -- As a wallet to deploy on testnets or mainnets.

>‚ö°Alchemy and Infura -- RPC entry points to blockchain.

>‚ö°Etherscan -- And other blockchain explorers to verify contracts, interact with them and get additional info.

>‚ö°VSCode and Git -- To develop and organize code, to be later updated on Github.

>‚ö°OpenZeppelin -- Libraries, specially ERC20 and ERC721.

>‚ö°Chainlink -- Tools to develop hybrid smart contracts, both Data Feeds and VRF. Soon working with Keepers.

>‚ö°Slither and Manticore -- From Trail of Bits to filter out smart contract vulnerabilities.

>‚ö°IPFS and Filecoin -- To store NFTs.
